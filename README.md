`wp-kit/theme:2.*` depends on several wp-kit components which were originally a part of [```wp-kit/core```](https://github.com/wp-kit/core).

This major change in `wp-kit/theme:2.*` is to allow more flexibility in adding ServiceProviders to `wp-kit/theme` and results in an unavoidable overhaul that deems `wp-kit/core` redundant.
